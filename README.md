Geoworld is an educational platformer game under development as a partnership between the Computing and Information Sciences department and the Geology Department of Kansas State University.

This branch (the precamera branch) is a reorganization of all of the code by the team doing the Precambrian Era. We put all of our changes in a branch in order to avoid breaking changes for people.

Other teams are welcome to pull changes from our branch into their own, but please don't push to the precamera branch if you are not on the Precambrian Era team.
